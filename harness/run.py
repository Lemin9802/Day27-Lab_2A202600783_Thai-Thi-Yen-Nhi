# Private is scoped tighter on fault difficulty than practice/public, so its
# budget is set separately: full single-pass coverage (one metered call per
# event) costs ~300 credits on private's 200-event stream — 220 would tax
# that at ~0.36 overage regardless of skill, compressing the gap between a
# real detector and doing nothing. 320 gives genuine full coverage a little
# headroom while still penalizing wasteful/redundant calls.
